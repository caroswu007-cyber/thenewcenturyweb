  overview: `The New Era of UMMA Organization (New Era of UMMa) is a dual-domain organization spanning both the Spirit Realm and the physical world.

In the physical world, the New Era of UMMA Organization oversees the Association of Spirit Realm's Ambassador (ASRA). Spirit Realm Ambassadors are human beings living in the physical world. Tens of thousands of members will be distributed across all nations, ethnicities, and cultural communities worldwide.

In the Spirit Realm, the New Era of UMMA Organization oversees the Society of Master Spirit Controllers (SMSC). The SMSC comprises tens of thousands of Master Spirit members. A Master Spirit is an administrator in the Spirit Realm who governs ordinary spirits (ghosts) and human beings.`,

Spirit (ghost) refers to the independent soul-life separated from the physical body after death. Spirit (soul) is the collective term for spirit and spirit (ghost).",
