  overview: `The Umma New Century Organization (New Century of UMMa) is a dual-domain organization spanning both the Spirit Realm and the physical world.

In the physical world, the Umma New Century Organization oversees the Association of Spirit Realm's Ambassador (ASra). Spirit Realm Ambassadors are human beings living in the physical world. Tens of thousands of members will be distributed across all nations, ethnicities, and cultural communities worldwide.

In the Spirit Realm, the Umma New Century Organization oversees the Society of Master Spirit Controllers (SMSC). The SMSC comprises tens of thousands of Master Spirit members. A Master Spirit is an administrator in the Spirit Realm who governs ordinary spirits (ghosts) and human beings.`,

        keyFeatures: 'Drawing on 12 peer-reviewed studies from Western universities and ICD-11 Category 6B6 (Spirit Attachment Disorders), this series maps the global distribution of spirit attachment and demonstrates its direct link to dissociative disorders, identity fragmentation, and unexplained psychological symptoms.',

        abstract: 'Near-death experiences (NDEs) — tunnels of light, deceased relatives, out-of-body journeys — are widely cited as proof of an afterlife. But this series proves: NDEs are not glimpses of death — they are hallucinations generated by attached spirits(ghosts). Through five analytical dimensions — consistency with other possession phenomena, visual structure, cross-cultural variation, and post-NDE psychic sequelae — this series dismantles the myth of NDEs as evidence of an afterlife.',

The host misinterprets these as their own past-life memories, leading to the widespread belief in reincarnation. This series demonstrates that reincarnation is a cognitive illusion, not a metaphysical reality.',
        keyFeatures: 'Rigorous logical analysis: The alleged “reincarnated self” has no biological continuity. It lacks a coherent sense of “I” — no unified identity, no persistent consciousness.

If spirits(ghost) lack eyes, this fundamentally challenges every cultural, religious, and metaphysical assumption about the afterlife. Across nearly all human cultures, the ethereal realm is depicted as containing hellfires, paradisiacal realms, demons, gods, and other spirits. But how can spirits(ghost) perceive these environments — or each other — without visual organs? How can the imagined existence of spirits(ghost) even be coherent without sight?',
        keyFeatures: 'This series draws upon 19 peer-reviewed academic papers from China’s most prestigious institutions — including the Institute of Physics and Institute of Biophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Peking University, National Taiwan University, Beijing Normal University, and the Shanghai Institute of Laser Technology — combined with the firsthand experiential accounts of the Wu family. Collectively, they provide conclusive evidence: spirits(ghost) do not possess eyes.',
